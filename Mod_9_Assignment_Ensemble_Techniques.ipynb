        "\n",
        "Bootstrap sampling means taking random samples from the original dataset with replacement.\n",
        "\n",
        "“With replacement” → after picking a data point, you put it back into the dataset before drawing the next one.\n",
        "\n",
        "This means:\n",
        "\n",
        "Some data points may appear multiple times in the sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some data points may not appear at all.\n",

        "\n",
        "Bagging = Bootstrap Aggregating → so bootstrap sampling is the foundation of Bagging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s what happens:\n",
        "\n",
        "From the original dataset, multiple bootstrap samples are created.\n",

        "A separate model (e.g., decision tree) is trained on each bootstrap sample.\n",

        "3. Why is Bootstrap Sampling Useful in Bagging?\n",
        "\n",
        "Diversity of models: Since each model is trained on a different random sample, they all learn slightly different patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reduces variance: Individual decision trees can overfit (high variance). But averaging many diverse trees reduces overfitting.\n",

        "Answer:\n",
        "1. What are Out-of-Bag (OOB) Samples?\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall: In bootstrap sampling, each new dataset is created by randomly sampling with replacement from the original data.\n",
        "\n",
        "On average, about 63% of the original data points end up in each bootstrap sample.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Role of OOB Samples\n",
        "\n",
        "Each base learner (tree) is trained on its bootstrap sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "The OOB samples for that tree are left out → the model hasn’t seen them during training.\n",

        "3. What is OOB Score?\n",

        "A Random Forest builds many decision trees on different bootstrap samples and random subsets of features.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each feature, the importance is computed as the average impurity reduction contributed by that feature across all trees in the forest.\n",

        "Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)\n",
        "\n",
        "Trains models sequentially; each new model focuses on errors of the previous ones.\n",
